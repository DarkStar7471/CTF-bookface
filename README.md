***Special Notes:***

​	*Scanning this specific box is a little different from most rooms. I highly recommend coming into this room with having set up Nessus or a similar higher-end scanning tool in order to produce better overall recon. Additionally, at the time of writing, this box has a fair amount of brute-forcing. Be prepared to solve this box over the series of several hours to a few days.*
